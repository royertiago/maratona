/* Problema C da 1Âª seletiva da UDESC de 2012.
 *
 * Longest common subsequence.
 *
 * The function "solve" below will solve the problem for a given bracelet orientation.
 * Note that, altough there are four possible orientations,
 * if both bracelets are inverted, their greatest "activation sequence"
 * is the same, just also reversed,
 * so there are two "really" different orientations.
 * Henceforth, we assume some orientation was fixed.
 *
 * Given a greatest activation sequence,
 * we may chose a starting point in one of the bracelets
 * and see where are the corresponding starting point in the other bracelet.
 * Linearize both bracelets; the activation sequence becomes
 * a common subsequence of the strings that represent the bracelet.
 * This subsequence must be the (or a) longest,
 * because, otherwise, we could generate a greater activation sequence
 * using a longer common subsequence.
 * Thus, the greatest activation sequence has the same size
 * of some longest common subsequence of some linearization of both bracelets.
 *
 * Observe that we have choosen the starting point in the first bracelet.
 * In the algorithm, we will make the choice of starting the first bracelet
 * exactly where its string start;
 * this way, the input string is exactly the chosen bracelet linearization.
 * So, we just need to iterate through all the linearizations of the second bracelet.
 * They are exactly all the circular permutations of the second string.
 *
 * Finally, note that any common subsequence of any linearization of both bracelets
 * yields a valid activation sequence --- just maybe smaller ones.
 *
 * Conclusion: when searching through all longest common subsequences
 * between the input string and all the circular permutations of the second string,
 * the greatest value we encounter is exactly the size
 * of the greatest activation sequence.
 *
 * Complexity: O(n^3).
